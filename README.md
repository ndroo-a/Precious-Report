# Precious Report

## Objective

This report is the first of four completed over the course of my Digital Forensics I class. The primary goal of this report was to learn the basics of harddrive analysis and reporting of a disk image. Through this report and its various requirements, it served as a thorough introduction into the uses of Autopsy in simulating the analysis of a harddrive, substituted by an E01 file. This experience also presented a great opportunity to improve report-writing skills including conciseness and detail orientation.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of report writing and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting EO1 files and harddrives.
- 
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Autopsy
